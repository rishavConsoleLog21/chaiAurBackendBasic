# JavaScript Backend Repo

This repository is dedicated to showcasing the power and versatility of JavaScript in backend development. From building robust APIs to handling database operations, this repo covers various aspects of backend programming using JavaScript. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, you'll find valuable resources, code samples, and tutorials to enhance your backend skills.

## JavaScript Backend File Structure

To create a basic file structure for a JavaScript backend, you can follow this convention:

```
├── app.js
├── routes
│   └── index.js
├── controllers
│   └── mainController.js
├── models
│   └── mainModel.js
├── config
│   └── config.js
├── utils
│   └── helper.js
└── package.json
```

Here's a brief explanation of each file and folder:

- `app.js`: The main entry point of your backend application.
- `routes`: This folder contains all the route files for your API endpoints.
- `controllers`: This folder contains the logic for handling requests and responses.
- `models`: This folder contains the data models and database schemas.
- `config`: This folder contains configuration files, such as database connection settings.
- `utils`: This folder contains utility functions or helper modules.
- `package.json`: The file that manages your project dependencies and scripts.

Feel free to customize this structure based on your specific project requirements.
